# TicTacToe
Just me learning to code in Python. Right now it's cli only and looks ugly, but it's a start.
Everyone is free to use this code, but why would you :) as I learn and expand on this game.
So far I have learned the basics of Python 3.x, Git and Github as well started coding in VS Code. 
I am updating this Readme.md file too often in a short period of time lol
